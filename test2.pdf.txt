P R O C E E D I N G S (Whereupon
was called as a witness and, after first being duly sworn
by the Foreperson of the Grand Jury, was examined and
testified as follows:)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Take a seat over there.  And all of the videos and
whatnot are going to be popping up behind you.  It's going
to be a bit wonky.  Sir, could you state your name and spell
it for the record, please?
Sure.  Justin, J-u-s-t-i-n, Marlow, M-a-r-l-o-w.
And sir, what do you do for a living?
I'm a detective with the Metropolitan Police
Department.
And what section are you currently assigned to?
I'm at the Homicide Branch.
How long have you been a detective?
Maybe six-and-a-half years now.
And how long have you been investigating
homicides?
Maybe three, three-and-a-half.
Detective, are you the lead detective on an
alleged shooting that took place on December 11th, 2020, at approximately 4:07 p.m. at the intersection of 29th and S Street, Southeast, here in Washington, D.C.?
Yes.
Did you draft an arrest warrant in that case?
Yes.
Who is that arrest warrant for?
Lewkus Turner.
All right.  Could you briefly summarize this investigation before we get started?
Yeah, sure.  So the Metropolitan Police Department received a call for the area of 29th and S -- I believe it was on the 11th -- for the report of a shooting.  Patrol officers responded out to the scene.  At some point, the board responded -- or D.C. Fire-EMS, and there were no signs of life and they weren't able to bring the decedent back.
So the Homicide Branch was called.  I responded to the scene as the lead investigator along with the rest of my squad and once there, we were provided with a litany of information, one reference to a witness in a white SUV that had fled the scene shortly after the shooting.  Family members initially indicated that there was some sort of verbal altercation between the decedent and his cousin, who possibly was driving the white SUV.  And we kind of dug in and ultimately determined that Lewkus Turner was involved in the shooting, who is the cousin of the decedent.  And he was subsequently arrested.
All right.  So let's start chronologically.
Sure.
I'm showing you what's been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 14.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 14 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Are you able to see that, Detective?
Yes.
So I'm scrolling down a bit on page 1.  What is Government's Exhibit 14?
So this is an Instagram post -- it's an Instagram Live post from the Instagram account that we identified as being Lewkus Turner's Instagram account.
And how did you obtain this post?
We obtained this post from a witness that provided it to us.
All right.  And was that a family member of the decedent?
Yes.
So who is this post made by?
Made from or made to?
Made from.
This post is made from Lewkus Turner's -- the name is onestopshorty.
Okay.  And is this post referring to his cousin or to @mge_ty?
Yes.  So the family provided information that the verbal altercation stemmed from this post right here, which was Lewkus Turner talking about another family member, saying that that cousin has COVID and to keep him away, and yada, yada, yada.  And that stemmed the verbal altercation between Lewkus Turner and Vincent Gyamfi.
Did you later obtain a search warrant for the account onestopshorty?
Yes.
And was that warrant signed on January 21st, 2021?
Yes, sir.
From what you could determine, were you able to find this particular post in that account at that time?
No.
And do you know why that post would not be there?
Yeah.  So this feature that many people use is Instagram Live.  So these are posts that automatically -- very similar to TikTok -- I don't know if people have that form of social media, but the posts that you make have an expiration date.  So you post them live and it keeps it for a short period of time.  And then if you don’t save it, once it expires, it's deleted from the social media platform all together automatically.
Okay.  Moving on, did you and the other detectives obtain surveillance video from areas around the shooting?
Yes.
I want to walk through the surveillance video with you in chronological order.  I'm showing you what's been marked for identification as Grand Jury Exhibit 15.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 15 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
And I'm pausing it at 15:55:01 in the top-left timestamp.
Yes, sir.
Is this surveillance video from a building located at 29th and R Street, Southeast?
Yes, sir.
So what's this building in the sort of center- right of the screen?
That's going to be 1620 29th Street.
And is it fair to say that 29th Street slopes down the hill in front of 1620 29th Street?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm playing from 15:55:01.  I'm going to play for about 15 seconds.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 15 was played.)
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm stopping at 15:55:15.
BY MR. KIMAK:
This vehicle that just turned down the street, does that appear consistent with the decedent's vehicle?
Yes, sir.
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm going to skip ahead in the interest of time.  So I'm stopping at 15:56:40 and I'm going to play for about a minute.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 15 was continued.)
WITNESS:  -- for attention purposes, this is who we believe right now is Lewkus Turner.  He's turning back and walking up the hill.
GRAND JUROR:  -- sorry, is he the guy in the crosswalk there --
WITNESS:  Yeah.  He's the one that just crossed the crosswalk with his hands in his pocket.  It looks like he has on a dark gray hat and a black jacket.  He's walking up 29th Street, about to pass the sign that says 29th and R.
MR. KIMAK:  And for the record, the video is stopped at 15:57:32.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, is it also fair to say that someone was crossing 29th Street going from left to right while walking a dog?
Yes, the individual right there.
Is that consistent with the testimony -- or excuse me, not the testimony -- is that consistent with what
W-7 told you about what he was doing that day?
Yes, sir.
And in fact, are you aware that W-7 said that he was walking his dog and walked by an individual that said when I come back, I'm going to kill you?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm going to keep playing until -- so I'm moving from 15:57:32 -- I'm going to play for about 45 seconds.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 15 was continued.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
So I'm stopping at 15:58:15.
Yes.
So in that clip that we just saw, did the silver sedan that we saw earlier pull out and drive down 29th Street?
Yeah.  So the silver sedan -- the decedent's vehicle, the Mercedes, is parked on the left side of the street.  As the FedEx vehicle goes by, the silver sedan pulls in front of the white Jeep and proceeds down the hill. It appeared to us that the FedEx vehicle turned left at the end of the block.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  So I'm playing from 15:58:15, but I'm actually going to skip ahead to 15:59.  So I've stopped at 15:58:57.  I'm going to play for about 30 seconds.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 15 was continued.)
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm stopping at 15:59:30.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, the white Suburban that came moving down 29th Street, did it stop at the same location that the silver sedan had left from?
Yes.
And the silver sedan that followed shortly behind the white SUV, was that consistent with the decedent's vehicle and consistent with the vehicle that we saw earlier in this clip?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm now going to switch to Exhibits 5A and 5B.  So I'm going to play both of those, okay? Starting with 5A.
(Grand Jury Exhibits 5A and 5B marked for identification.)
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 5A was played.)
MR. KIMAK:  So I've played 5A.  Now I'm going to play 5B.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 5B was played.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
So I've stopped 5A -- or excuse me, I've stopped 5B.  I'm now pulling up 5A again, but I'm going to pause it at 26 seconds using the lower-left timestamp.
Yes.
Detective, do we know what exactly was said during the interaction depicted in these two clips?
Not exactly, no.
Did  W-7 say that the person he saw earlier saying I'm going to kill you was standing on the floorboard of this white vehicle holding a gun?
Yes.
Did you contact W-7 he date after he testified before the grand jury?
Yes.
And did you ask him if he ever saw the heavyset person that was arguing with the driver of the white vehicle -- if he saw him with a gun?
Yes.
And what did W-7 tell you?
He stated that he never saw the heavy individual with a handgun.
And did W-7 have a clear view of the heavyset individual's hands?
Yes.
Okay.  Moving on.  Was --
If I may, he stated that he didn't see him with any weapon at all, so yeah.
So Detective, was a 911 call made in reference to this incident?
Yes.
I am -- probably more accurately saying I'm going to attempt to play Government's Exhibit 16.  I'll see if the sound works.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 16 marked for identification.)
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 16 was played.)
MR. KIMAK:  All right.  So I've stopped at 2 seconds.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, is this the 911 call that was made in reference to the altercation between the silver sedan and the white SUV on 29th Street?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  I'm going to play Government's Exhibit 16.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 16 was continued.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, I'm now showing you -- or excuse me, was this call made by the same person that provided the videos that we just saw?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  I'm showing you what's been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 17.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 17 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
It's stopped at 00 on the bottom-left timestamp.
Yes, sir.
The timestamp in the bottom-right reads 12/11/2020, 16:06:51; is that accurate?
I believe so.
Can you orient the jury to this video?
Sure.  So this video right here is a depiction of S Street, which is flowing this way, east to west.  And 29th Street is right down here at this intersection down here.
So 29th Street, down the hill, which we were just watching, this is one block up.  So down the street would be R and going up the street one block at S.  We see the white Suburban SUV.  And then right here, close to the corner, you can see the decedent's vehicle, the silver Mercedes.
And just to be clear, this white SUV that's driving -- actually, hold on.  I'm going to play about six seconds' worth, so from 00.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 17 was played.)
MR. KIMAK:  I'm stopping at 6 seconds.
BY MR. KIMAK:
So Detective, the white SUV that just pulled up, does this appear to be the same vehicle that we saw in the previous videos?
Yes, sir.
So the area where it stopped, you said that that's the decedent's vehicle?
Yes.
How do you know that's the decedent's vehicle?
Oh, well that's where -- we recovered it from the scene, of course.  We searched the vehicle, its personal effects, and it was identified by the family as being his vehicle.  So it's quite obvious.
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm playing from 6 seconds to the end of the video -- or end of the clip.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 17 was continued.)
MR. KIMAK:  So Exhibit 17 has stopped.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Just to be clear, Detective, has this video been edited or cut off or truncated?
No, not at all.
So this is what was provided by Ring?
Yes, sir.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  I'm now showing you what's been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 18.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 18 marked for identification.)
MR. KIMAK:   I'm stopping at -- the timestamp in the top right reads 05:05:33 p.m.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, can you orient the jury to this video?
Sure.  So this video is taken from the property at the corner of 29th and S.  I don't know if you can see -- the bottom-right corner picks up where the other video left off.  So you see the white SUV pulling into the intersection.  I believe the time is off maybe an hour from this video.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  So I'm going to play this video, starting from 00 -- or excuse me, starting from 05:05:33.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was played.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, so the video has stopped, but I'm going to play it again and advance it to around 48 seconds.  The timestamp reads 05:06:20.  Detective, is this the location where the decedent's body was found?
Yeah.  You can see the decedent's body here. That's where the decedent's remains were found when officers initially arrived on scene.  You could see the decedent -- a portion of the decedent's remains got stuck under the vehicle.  His cousin pulls his body -- drags his body from under the vehicle and then drives off.
Stepping back for a second, can you explain for the grand jury what ShotSpotter is?
Sure.  So ShotSpotter is a system that we have in the city.  It's a series of indicators that -- I don't know if you see them, but they're on light poles and electrical poles inside of these various areas in the city. ShotSpotter triangulates any gunshots that happen in the city.  It uses a technology that uses the sound in the distance to find out where -- or a general area of where gunshots happen.  And that's the technology that we use frequently to find out where shootings happen but also to mark the time because for us, as detectives, time is everything.
All right.  So Detective, in addition to providing this information about the approximate location --
Yes.
-- and number of shots, does ShotSpotter also give you, like, an actual sound recording of the gunshots?
Yes, sir.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  I'm playing what's been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 19.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 19 marked for identification.)
MR. KIMAK:  And because there's a bit of a delay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to start playing this clip, but then I'm quickly going to advance it back to 00 because I think it takes about a second for this audio system to kick in.  So with that, I'm playing.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 19 was played.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
So I believe all three gunshots were just audible --
Yes.
-- in the grand jury room.  So it is fair to say that there were three gunshots that were picked up by ShotSpotter?
Yes, sir.
And was the medical examiner able to determine how many times the decedent was shot?
Three.
And is it fair to say that there was approximately 1 second in between each shot?
Yes, sir.
I'm going to switch back to the surveillance video.  I'm showing you what has been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 20.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 20 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Now Detective, is it fair to say that this is from the same camera as 18?  It's just zoomed out?
Yes.
Okay.  So I am going to advance it to the timestamp of 15:06 -- I apologize -- so 15:06:08, and I'm going to play about 3 minutes' worth, okay?
Yes.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 20 was played.)
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm stopping at 5:09:40.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, is it fair to say that during this portion that we just watched, several people appear to approach the decedent's body and do something?
Yes.
But do we know for certain what they're doing?
No.
Is it possible that they could be trying to provide medical aid to the decedent?
That's the way it appeared to me.
At the end of the video, are those MPD officers that are bending over the decedent's body?
Yes.  I believe it's three MPD officers.  I don't know if you see them.  They're wearing dark clothing, one of them.  You can see them.  I think they're trying to key their radio.  And when they turn around, you can see the white writing on the back from their vests.  So it appeared to me to be three officers that were approaching, initially responding to the call for the verbal altercation and then responding up the hill as the shooting happened.
Okay.  I’m going to ask you about the murder scene itself.  First, was a 7.62 mm shell casing found on scene near the decedent's body?
Yes.
Detective, are you familiar with firearms and bullets from your work?
Sure.
What types of weapons are associated with 7.62 mm casings?
Assault rifles, particularly AK-47s.
Are you familiar with a weapon commonly called a Draco?
Yes, sir.
Could you just describe a Draco for the grand jury?
Yeah.  So a Draco is a smaller version of an AK- 47.  The barrel is shorter and the butt stock is usually taken off.  It's carried as a pistol and can be concealed and fired with one hand as a pistol even though it fires an assault rifle round.
So is that consistent with the shell casing that was recovered from the scene?
Yes, sir.
Were any weapons found on the decedent?
No.
Any weapons found near the decedent?
No.
And that includes firearms and knives or anything else --
Yes.
I'm now showing you what's been marked for identification as Grand Jury Exhibit 21.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 21 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, what is this?
So this is our crime scene.  Everything is marked at this point.  Down there at the bottom, you can see the tire track through the crosswalk with the decedent's blood and the vehicle's tire track, along with several other items that were collected from the scene.
So is the location of this tire print consistent with the white SUV driving through the decedent's blood as it flees the scene?
Yes.
Next I would like to ask you about some of the people that were stopped on scene.
Yes, sir.
First, are you familiar with a man named W-5
W-5
Yes.
Was  W-5 stopped on scene about 20 minutes -- or excuse me, 10 minutes after the shooting, after police thought he was fleeing the scene?
Yes.
And did W-5 say that's my cousin that got
shot?
Yes.
And did he tell the police that they could search
his vehicle?
Yes.
Did the police actually search his vehicle?
I don’t believe so.
Instead, did the police just ask him if he saw
anything?
Yes.
And did W-5 provide any information to
the police about this shooting on scene?
No.
Next, did the police notice four individuals
leaving the shooting scene at what they described as a fast
pace together when the police arrived?
Yes.
So are these individuals captured on surveillance
video near the decedent's body?
No, not near the decedent's body.
Okay.  I mean, is it -- are you -- can you say
that with 100 percent certainty?
No, you can't.  But it doesn't appear to me off of the surveillance footage that they were around the decedent's body.
Was one of these individuals seen opening the door to a white Infiniti sedan that was parked in front of 1613 29th Street, Southeast?
Yes.
And just to be clear, is that location -- is that near where this altercation took place --
It's about --
-- between the --
Yeah.  It's about --
-- silver sedan and the SUV?
-- a block away, yeah.
Well, I'm sorry.  Between -- so the earlier altercation between the silver sedan and the white SUV --
Oh, yes.
So was the white Infiniti, like, in that area?
Yes.
Okay.  So did the police stop these individuals and detain them until detectives arrived?
Yes.
Did the police also detain the Infiniti sedan?
Yes.
Did the police bring a dog trained in the detection of firearms to that white Infiniti and have it sniff around the vehicle?
Yes.
And did that dog alert to the vehicle, indicating that it had detected the scent of a firearm?
Yes.
Did the police then search the vehicle?
Yes.
And did the police find a firearm inside the vehicle?
No.
Finally, I would like to ask you about a man named
W-1 Did W-1 approach a police officer
about 40 minutes after the shooting?
Yes.
And did W-1 provide some information to the
officer?
Yes.
So according to the officer, what did W-1
say?
W-1 pproaches the officer and indicates in his conversation with the officer that the vehicle that we're looking for to be involved in the shooting is the white SUV.  He provides a tag number to the vehicle and states that the vehicle has been in the area during various periods of time over the last few days, and he took note of the vehicle.  And he gave information to the officer that indicated that the shooter was involved -- or the person that's occupying -- driving the SUV is involved in the shooting of the decedent.
Did W-1 - at least according to the officer, did  W-1 also report that the driver of the white SUV had a baby K?
Yes.  He stated that he observed the baby K, which is also another name for a Draco or a small AK-47.  And that was something that he observed in the driver's possession.
Okay.  Were the police able to locate the white SUV seen in the surveillance videos?
Yes.
Could you explain to the grand jury how the police were able to locate the vehicle?
Sure.  So when W-1 gave us the tag number, of course, at this time, I'm on the scene, so we -- Homicide has taken control of the investigation.  So we run the tag and the tag comes back to a rental car company.  And of course, we know, first off, given the model year of the vehicle, the estimated model year, we knew that it most likely had OnStar, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's activated.  But once we found out that the vehicle was a rental vehicle, then we knew -- or believed that most rental car companies have tracking devices on their vehicles so they can find them.  So we contacted Hertz and they did have a tracking device on the vehicle and were able to give us the plot and points of where the vehicle was and where it came from, the speed, and all that other stuff.
All right.  So who rented the vehicle?
So the vehicle was rented by Lewkus Turner's mother, W-2
Did the police speak with W-2 about this vehicle?
Sure, yes.  We spoke with her.
And what did she say?
She stated that her -- she rented the vehicle for her son a few days prior because he had been involved in some type of car accident.  She rented the vehicle for him and did not give anyone else permission to operate the vehicle, stated that no one else should be driving the vehicle because she rented it for him.
Okay.  Did W-2 then try to contact her son?
Yes.
And did those calls go straight to voicemail?
Yes.  Those calls went straight to voicemail.
And just to be clear, this conversation about the rental vehicle, did this take place on December 11th?
Yes.
Were police able to locate and seize the vehicle on December 11th?
Yes, sir.
And did W-2 eport the vehicle stolen
on December 22nd?
Yeah, she did.
And when she reported the vehicle stolen, did she
say that her son had the keys to the vehicle but that she
did not know where her son was?
Yes.  That's exactly what she said.
Did you obtain a search warrant for this vehicle?
Yes.
Were any firearms recovered from the vehicle?
No firearms in the vehicle.
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm showing you what's been marked
for identification as Grand Jury Exhibit 22.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 22 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, what is this?
So that's a bullet hole from the -- excuse me, the
driver's door in the driver's area.  Based off my
experience, it appears that the bullet is going in a
downward angle and going downward from inside the car out of
the exterior of the vehicle, which indicates to us that -- excuse me?  Oh, I thought you cut me off -- which indicates to us that that shot came from the interior of the vehicle out.
All right.  Was a suspected blood stain found in the rear driver-side tire?
Yes.
Were any shell casings found inside the vehicle?
Yes.  We recovered one shell casing from the interior of the vehicle.
And what was the caliber of that shell casing?
7.62.
Was this shell casing sent to an outside expert for comparison to the casing found at the scene?
Yes.
So at this time, have you received the results of that comparison from the outside expert?
No, sir.
Were DNA swabs obtained from various locations around the vehicle?
Yes.
And were those swabs sent to an outside lab for testing?
Yes.
So were the DNA swabs from each -- were the DNA profiles from each swab compared to a DNA sample from the decedent?
Yes.
At this time, have any DNA comparisons been done between these swabs and the defendant?
No.
Why not?
Because, I guess, we have to send them off and a whole bunch of stuff that has to happen.
Is it fair to say that you're in a process of getting that information back, but --
Yeah.
-- as of yet --
It takes forever.
Okay.  I'm now going to read several statements -- or several questions.  It might be a bit hard to digest, so --
Sure.
-- I'm going to try and go slow.  So did the DNA analysis determine that swabs from a suspected blood stain on the interior front driver-side door was a mixture of two individuals with at least one male contributor and that obtaining this mixture profile was approximately 7.23 billion times more likely if the DNA originated from Vincent Gyamfi, the decedent, and one unknown, unrelated individual than if the DNA originated from two unknown, unrelated individuals?
Yes.
Did the analysis determine that swabs from suspected blood on the front driver-side door locker panel originated from a single individual and that obtaining this profile was approximately 94.6 septillion times more likely if the DNA originated from Vincent Gyamfi than if the DNA originated from an unknown, unrelated individual?
Yes.
Did the analysis determine that swabs of the interior front driver-side door handles, controls, and arm rest was a mixture of three individuals with at least one male contributor and that obtaining this mixture profile was approximately 123 quintillion times more likely if the DNA originated from Vincent Gyamfi and two unknown, unrelated individuals than if the DNA originated from three unknown, unrelated individuals?
Yes.
Did the analysis determine that the swabs from the steering wheel and controls, gear shift lever, wiper and light controls, rearview mirror, and driver-side seat adjustor was a mixture of three individuals with at least one male contributor and that obtaining this mixture profile was approximately 105 billion times more likely if the DNA originated from Vincent Gyamfi and two unknown, unrelated individuals than if the DNA originated from three unknown, unrelated individuals?
Yes.
Most importantly, did the analysis determine that the swabs from the rear driver-side tire originated from a single individual and that obtaining this profile was approximately 109 septillion times more likely if the DNA originated from Vincent Gyamfi than if the DNA originated from an unknown, unrelated individual?
Yes.
Did the analysis determine that swabs of a black mask with mesh filter recovered from inside the vehicle was a mixture of three individuals with at least one male contributor and that obtaining this mixture profile was approximately 4.31 septillion times more likely if the DNA originated from Vincent Gyamfi and two unknown, unrelated individuals than if the DNA originated from three unknown, unrelated individuals?
Yes, sir.
Moving on.  Did you obtain an arrest warrant for Lewkus Turner?
Yes, sir.
And was Mr. Turner arrested in Prince George's County at his girlfriend's apartment on December 29th, 2020?
Yes, sir.
Where specifically in the apartment was Mr. Turner found?
He was hiding in a closet inside of the residence.
Was Mr. Turner detained at the D.C. jail following his arrest?
Yes, sir.
And are people detained at the D.C. jail able to make phone calls to folks outside of the jail?
Yes.
And are these calls recorded?
Yes, sir.
Have you reviewed some but not all of Mr. Turner's recorded calls?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  I'm playing what has been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 23.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 23 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, is this a recorded call between Mr. Turner and his mother,  W-2 on December 30th, 2020?
Yes, sir.
In fact, is this the first recorded call that Mr. Turner made to anyone?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  So -- nope.  It's not going to work. Stand by.  Folks, if you want to listen to this call later when you have the disc, you have to use Windows Media Player to open it.  That's just a little note.  And I'm going to skip over the first --
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 23 was played.)
MR. KIMAK:  So this is Government's Exhibit 23 and I'm going to skip to about 2:30 and play from there.  It's playing from 2:28.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 23 was continued.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
So the recording is stopped at 7:34.
Yes.
Detective, earlier in the clip, we heard Mr. Turner say that when Vinnie grabbed at that john -- what is a john?
It's a thing.  It could be anything, but in -- the context is everything, I guess you could say.  So in this context, it sounds to me that he is referring to the gun and he is referring to the gun and attempting to tell his mother that the decedent shot himself.  So he grabbed it and shot himself.
Just two sets of wrap-up questions.  Was Lewkus Turner previously convicted of a crime carrying one year or more of incarceration?
Yes.
Finally, did W-4 provide you with some text messages between her and her aunt,  W-2
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  I'm showing you what's been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 24.
(Grand Jury Exhibit 24 marked for identification.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
And are these those texts that she provided to you?
Yes.
And just to be clear, the blue is coming from Ms.
W-4
Yes.
And then these messages in gray are coming from
W-2
Yes.
Is that correct?  Okay.
MR. KIMAK:  So folks, I don't think we're going to have time to do a summation quite yet, but I would like you to take this opportunity to ask Detective Marlow any questions that you may like to have -- or any questions that you do have.  I'll actually start with the folks in Room 3 first.  Do we have any questions from Room 3?
GRAND JUROR:  Is it possible to see that video again where the shooting actually occurs?
MR. KIMAK:  Sure.  That's more a question for me rather than Detective Marlow, but I believe you're referring to Government's Exhibit 18.
GRAND JUROR:  Right.
MR. KIMAK:  Which I'm pulling up.  So 18 is now on the screen.  It's stopped at 1 second.  The timestamp in the top right is 05:05:33.
Sir, is there anything in particular that you would like to see?
GRAND JUROR:  Could the detective speak to what's occurring during the video?
WITNESS:  Sure.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Yeah.  So Detective, what I'm going to do is I'm going to play -- I think it's easier for the court reporter and for a future transcript.  So I'm going in just, like, chunks.  And I'll pause it and ask you to narrate what's going on.
Sure.
So first of all, what do we see right now where it's paused at 05:05:33?
Yeah.  So you see the white SUV in the center of the intersection of 29th and S Street.
Okay.
GRAND JUROR:  Where is the decedent at this point?
WITNESS:  So in relation to the other video clip, his vehicle should be parked on S Street directly right of where the white SUV is -- in a parked position, in a parking space.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  So I'm going to play from 05:05:33.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
MR. KIMAK:  And I'm stopping at 05:05:36.
BY MR. KIMAK:
So Detective, what just happened?
So what you're observing is the decedent approaching and it appears to even open the driver-side door of the vehicle.  It seems to be a continuation of whatever verbal altercation they were having seconds before.
You mentioned that he appears to even possibly open the door first.  Do you know for certain, like, who actually opens the door?
No.
But do we know that the door must be unlocked at this point?  Is that correct?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm playing from 05:05:36.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm stopping at 05:05:48.
BY MR. KIMAK:
What happened now?
Yes.  So the decedent is inside of the driver-side door area of the vehicle.  Based off of ShotSpotter and other indications that we have in the area, when that vehicle that's parked starts to back up and the driver -- or excuse me, the passenger gets out and takes cover, that's when the succession of shots occur.  And you'll see the decedent's body collapse to the ground.  And that's when you'll see the driver of the SUV, the Suburban, who is also wearing all black, move the body and flee the scene.
So at this point, is it fair to say that there's two individuals that are on their feet?
Yes.
The driver and the decedent?
Yes, within the doorframe.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  So I'm playing from 05:05:48.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
MR. KIMAK:  And I'm stopping at 05:05:53.
BY MR. KIMAK:
So what happened just now?
Yeah.  So you see Mr. Turner step out of the vehicle.  He puts his hand on the rear driver-side passenger door as the vehicle strikes his cousin on the ground.  Then it appears that he gets in the car maybe to put it in park or stop the vehicle from progressing forward, moves the body, and then flees the scene.
So is it fair to say that the driver must have gotten out of the car, but the car is still in drive?
Drive, yes.
So it's just automatically -
Yes, sir.
-- rolling forward?  And then what stops it from continuing to move forward?
I believe it's the decedent's shoulder and head.
Okay.  So it's getting stuck on the decedent's body?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  So I'm playing from 05:05:53.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
MR. KIMAK:  So I'm stopping at 05:06:02.
BY MR. KIMAK:
So what just happened then?
He starts moving the decedent's body from under the vehicle.
So is it fair to say that the driver must have gone back to the -- gotten into the car, put the car into park, then climbed -- then gone back out and pulled the decedent out of the way?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  Playing from 05:06:02.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
And that -- is it fair to say that the driver -- the video stopped at 05:06:18.  So is it fair to say the driver gets back in and drives away?
Yes, drives through the decedent's blood and through the crosswalk and drives away.
MR. KIMAK:  Sir, did that answer your question?
GRAND JUROR:  It did.  Can I ask a follow-up?
MR. KIMAK:  Of course.
GRAND JUROR:  Did the detective have access, I guess, obviously to the autopsy report that would show a gun wound of very close distance to the clothes or to the body?
WITNESS:  I believe he's referring to stippling [ph].
MR. KIMAK:  I believe so, yeah.
WITNESS:  Yes, I had access to it.  I didn't review that form before coming in to this testimony, sir.  I can't recall.  I don't believe that the doctor indicated stippling, but I can't recall right now.
GRAND JUROR:  Okay.  Thank you.
GRAND JUROR:  Can you clarify when the shots were actually fired?  Because it kind of looks like the defendant actually switched spots with the person who kind of --
WITNESS:  Yeah.  So we learned -- and I don't know the exact time.  But to clarify, I think what you're getting at is yes, based off the blood spatter inside of the vehicle and where we found the blood at, yes, the decedent collapses on the driver after being shot.  And the driver kind of wedges his way around the decedent, causing the decedent's body to fall, causing the vehicle to move forward as he takes his foot off the break.  And then the vehicle stops. So yes, he shoots him and then the decedent's body falls on top of him.
BY MR. KIMAK:
So I've moved 18 back to 05:05 --
Yes.
-- :41.  I'll play from this point.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
So it's stopped at 05:05:43.  Is it -- so is it fair to say that this gold vehicle had just opened the door?
Yes.
And is it your testimony that that appears consistent with, like, the gunshot going off?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  And then playing from 05:05:43.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
And then I'll stop at 05:05:50.  And now we've got one person puling the other person, pulling the decedent out of the way; is that correct?
Yes, sir.
MR. KIMAK:  Any other questions from Room 3?
GRAND JUROR:  Yes.  So the gun -- the bullet hole found in the car was angled downwards, so the theory being it came from within the car and came out?
WITNESS:  Yes.  Do you have that picture?
MR. KIMAK:  So this is Government's Exhibit 21.
WITNESS:  And I don't know if they can see this to give a little bit more context.  So yes, the bullet hole is at a downward angle.  But just so people understand the blood spatter and what we swab, right here is a portion of the blood that we actually swabbed and the trim, which for us -- and I was gesturing towards here, these two spatters here -- but for us, it's very consistent with somebody being shot and the actual bullet -- or the projectile that's going through the body causing a release of blood as it travels through the body in a downward motion.  So that was consistent for us based off of the injuries that we found on the decedent's body.
GRAND JUROR:  Thank you.
GRAND JUROR:  And this was like a through and through?  Not like a -- I don't know --
WITNESS:  I didn't hear --
GRAND JUROR:  -- exit the --
MR. KIMAK:  Yeah, I think I can --
GRAND JUROR:  This -- after it exited the decedent's body?
WITNESS:  I think all of the shots went through, but I'm not 100 percent sure.  I know that those rounds -- and the 7.62 rounds are made to cause maximum damage and go through the body.  That's just the way they're made.
MR. KIMAK:  Perhaps I can phrase the question a different way.
BY MR. KIMAK:
Detective, the decedent was shot three times; is that correct?
Yes.
Like, the medical examiner said he had three gunshot wounds?
Yes, sir.
And the ShotSpotter records three gunshots?
Yes, sir.
And yet we also have this damage to the vehicle?
Yes.
So would that be consistent with -- is the most likely explanation for that set of circumstances that at least one of the shots went through the decedent and then through the door of the vehicle?
Yes, sir.
GRAND JUROR:  Were two bullets found in the decedent's body?
WITNESS:  I'm not sure.
MR. KIMAK:  Well, his testimony is that --
BY MR. KIMAK:
You're not sure?
No.
And like you said, you haven't reviewed the autopsy --
Report, yeah.
-- file lately?
In probably a year, yeah.
MR. KIMAK:  Any other questions from Room 3?  Turn on over to Room 5 then.  Any questions for Detective Marlow? Sir?
GRAND JUROR:  Were all the shots fired at the decedent while he was in the vehicle or were some shots fired once he was --
WITNESS:  That's unclear.  That's unclear to us. And I guess you're asking -- is if he was shot several times, and then when the driver gets out, if there's more shots that go into him?  Is that what you're asking?
GRAND JUROR:  Yeah.  So was he shot when -- because it looks like they were in some type of altercation or whatever between them, initially.  And then he fell outside of the truck and that's when he got just run over or whatever.  But was he -- were all three shots fired when he was in the truck?  Or were any shots fired once he was no longer part of the altercation and was just defenseless?
WITNESS:  Yeah.  That's unclear.  That's unclear to us.
MR. KIMAK:  And one thing that might shed some light on that particular question.  So I've got Government's Exhibit 18 pulled up.  It's at 05:05:50.
BY MR. KIMAK:
And Detective, we were just talking about how we think that the door opening is in response to these gunshots; is that correct?
Yes.
So we don't know which of the three gunshots it is, but we do know that  -- or at least, your testimony is it appears that this is when the gunshots occurred; is that right?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  All right.  So I'm going to play the ShotSpotter recording in Exhibit 19.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 19 was continued.)
BY MR. KIMAK:
And so I sort of -- because I had to repeat it --
Yes.
So fair to say there's three shots --
Yes.
-- about one second apart from each other?
Yes.
So we don’t know precisely -- like, we can't tell from the video precisely when those shots occurred?  But they at least occurred fairly close together, right?
Yes.
So there's a break, but it's not like -- there's not a significant break?
No.
Is that fair to say?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  Sir, does that help answer your question at all?
GRAND JUROR:  Yes.
GRAND JUROR:  So is that -- would that be three trigger pulls?  Or were those -- the clustering of the shot sounds?  Or is that an automatic?
WITNESS:  So in my experience, that sounded like it was three trigger pulls.
GRAND JUROR:  Thank you.
BY MR. KIMAK:
But just to be clear, does that -- did you recover --
No.
-- the firearm used in this?  Okay.  So you don't know that it's capable of automatic fire, for example?
Yes.
MR. KIMAK:  Okay.  Sir?
GRAND JUROR:  So in the previous video -- so the decedent ran up to the car.  And it was difficult for me to tell by looking at it, but is it possible that -- were they struggling before the shots?  Was he, like, throwing punches or something at the driver?  Is that possible -- that was happening?  Or can you tell from that video?
WITNESS:  To me -- and this is me looking at the video, like, on my computer -- it didn't appear that there was some type of physical altercation.  It was kind of --
GRAND JUROR:  Did not appear?
WITNESS:  No.  I didn't think -- I thought that these two being cousins, like, people that grew up and lived with each other all their life, knowing what I know, it appears that whenever you got an altercation or argument that was the decedent's nature to, you know, get in people's face, provoke, or however you want to call it.  That's how emotional he is.  So I didn't see even down the hill or up the hill the decedent throw a punch or push or anything like that, but definitely yelling, definitely emotion.
MR. KIMAK:  And again, I've pulled up 18 at 05:05:35.  This is as the decedent is running up to the vehicle.  And I'm playing from this point.
(Whereupon, Grand Jury Exhibit 18 was continued.)
MR. KIMAK:  Now stopping at 05:05:51.
GRAND JUROR:  This is a question for either of you.  Was anything shared from the person that was in the gold vehicle that we haven't --
BY MR. KIMAK:
That's a question for you because I am not --
WITNESS:  The individuals inside of the gold vehicle?
GRAND JUROR:  Yes.
WITNESS:  I actually haven't -- I couldn't tell you how long me and my partner did surveillance on that corner.  We spoke to property management staff, construction workers, and just about everybody in this intersection. Nobody knew who they were.
We looked for this vehicle.  I don’t know if it was somebody that was just sitting there eating lunch or somebody -- but it doesn't seem to me as a detective that they live there because nobody knew them.  There's other individuals, of course, we identified.  But no, it would've been great -- oh my God -- to get that type of firsthand information.
MR. KIMAK:  Any other questions for Detective Marlow?  Okay.
BY MR. KIMAK:
So Detective, you can step outside.  And actually, I'm going to join you.  I'm going to check with Pat on the scheduling.
Yes, sir.
MR. KIMAK:  I think you all had some cancellations later today and I'll probably be able to get back in.
WITNESS:  Thank you.
MR. KIMAK:  Thank you very much.
(Whereupon, the witness was excused at 11:41 a.m.
on February 8, 2022.)
